javascript: it is use to add functionality and behaviour into webapp.
            - it is interpreated language.
            - it is loseely typed language.

*There are two ways to use javascript
1.internal javascript : in html file we use script and in that script we write jscode.
2.external javascript : first we create a sperate js file and that js file we import in html file by using  script tag.

*How to display output in js
1.document.write() : it will display output on web page on html page.
2.window.alert(): it will generate one pop up window and dispaly our code init.
3.console.log(): it will give output in browser control or in terminal.
4.innerHtml(DOM): it allows us to insert data on inside the element.

- in javascript window is global object
By using DOM how to set, get value from element.
-how to apply style rule to an element by using DOM 

*function.
- it is block of code, which is use to perform specific task.
-it will execute only when it is called.

*There are mainlt two types of function,
1.predefine function: provided by javascript.
2.user-define function: created by user.

* how to use onclick event.

*Data types
There are two types data types
1.premitive datatypes: number, string, boolean , undefine, null
2.non-premitive data type : array, object

*Array:
- it is used to store multiple values with same data type in single variable.
- in array values store on index basics
- array index always start from 0(Zero) index.
- array denoted by [] bracket

*Length of Array : total number of values available in it.
syntax : arrayName.Length
*Arrat Size : total nu,ber of index
syntax: arrayName.length-1

*Array method

*object data type:
-it is used to store multiple values with different datatypes in single variable.
-in object data store in key and value in paire format.
-we can access object data outside for that we write object, keyName.
-object denoted by {}

callback function: passing one function as an argument inside another function is called callback function.

*settime out method: it will call another method only once after particular time interval.
          - it takes two parameter 1.callback function, 2.Time in millisecond

*seinterval method: it will call another method multiple time after particular time interval
           - it takes two parameter 1.callback function, 2.Time in millisecond.

*Date and its method
-if you want to get date and time in web page by using javascript for firdt we have to create object of date class.
- in javascript date class return date and time 
        syntax: - let dateobj= new Date();

        sun=0...................mom=6

let datw= new datw(year, month,date hours,second,millisecond)

* nodejs is used to exceute on server side

*Exponentiation operator : it will returm power of any number.
in javascript there are two operator
1. == - it check only value. if values are same then it return true result.
2 === - it check both value as well as its datatypes if both are same then and only that is shows true result.
ex. 
  5**5 => true
  '5' => true
  5==5 => true
  '5'==5 => false

*Hoisting - it is javascript default behaviour which moves variable and function decleration at top of page. means we can use variable before declration of it.
        
*different between var, let and const

var : 
 - it support hoisting concepts.
 -we can yse variable before decleration of it.
 -we can use re-declera it.

 let:
   - it do npt support hoisting concept.
   - we can not use variable before decleration of it.
   - we can not re-declear it.

const:
   - it is use to create variable with constant value.
   - when we declear constant variable at same time we have to intilize it.
   -constant variable value will never change on run time.

*Math method: it is used to perform mathematic operation.
             - provides inbulit method.

math.ceil(5.6) = > 6
math.ceil(5.1) = > 6
math.floor(5.8) = > 5
math.floorl(5.1) = > 5
math.round(5.4) = > 5


string and its method
-it is collection of character.
-in string every letter has index number.
-character index from zero index.
-in string black space is also consider as string.

*How to find index of searching string.
1. insexof: ("search-string",index);
 -it will return index of first occurance of searching string.
 -it will search string from left to right direction.
 -if searching string not found then it will return -1 result.

2. lastIndexof:("search-string",index)
it will return index of first occurance of searching string.
 -it will search string from right to left direction.
 -if searching string not found then it will return -1 result.


3.search:
it will return index of first occurance of searching string.
 -it will search string from left to right direction.
 -if searching string not found then it will return -1 result.
 -it is faster then index of method.


* how to find part of string from big string
4. slice :(start-index,end-index)
        - it will return partial part of string from index number.
        - slice method will search string from left to right when we pass +view of index.
        - slice method will search string from right to left when we pass -view of index.

5. substring: :(start-index,end-index)
         - it will return partial part of string from index number.
        - slice method will search string from left to right when we pass +view of index.
       
6. substr :(start-index,total-number-character)
   - it will return partial part of string from index number.
        - slice method will search string from left to right when we pass +view of index.

7. split(separe): it is used to converting string data into array

8. replace("newText","oldText);

9.charAt(index): it return  single available  on index number


*ESS(ECMA script)2009:
"use script" :
-it execute javascript code in strict mode, in this we can not use variable before decleration of it.
- it always write starting of jscode

2.trim() : it is used to remove unwanted white space of both side of string.

-for each
-map
-filter-
-every-some-
-reduce or reduceRight :

*propt : it generate one popup window and allowa user to insert data init.
        task:get value by using pront display whether enter alphabet or vowel or consonenr

*Form Validation
*Perform form validation after submitting form
 - for this we use onsubmit event

* perform from validation before submitting form
  - for this we use onblur event

  *How to merge two or more array
  1. By using concat method
  2. By using spread operator

  * Destructuring : creating constant variable and strong data in ti.
                   - we can Destructuring array and object in it.
