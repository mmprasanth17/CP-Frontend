*Typescript :- it is superset of javascript.
             - it is compile language.
             - it is strict type language

*software pre-requist:
1.nodejs
     - node -v // it will show node version.
     npm -v // it will show npm version

2.Typescript
       - npm i typescript -g   // it will install typescript
       - tsc -v                // it will display typescript version

*We can create typescript file by writing fileName.ts
*How to execute typescript file.

step 1: tsc fileName.ts       // it will compile ts file and generate plain js file.
step 2: node fileName.js      // it will execute js file

*how to create variable in typescript
syntax: let variableName:datatypes;

*data types in Typescript

write a function with three parameter fname,mnname and lname and display fullname


*oops

1. class: it is collection of data-member and member function.
         - it is templete which we can reuse.
         - to create a class we use class keyword.
         - class name must start with capital letter.
         syntax: class classname{
          data-member and membere function
         }
         - this: it repeat current or current object

2.object: it is an instance of class
         - by using object we can asses class data-member and member-function outside class
         syntax: let objName = new Classname();

- constructor : - it is special member function of class.
                - constructor excute automitcally when class object is created or initializr.
                - constructor name must be only constructor in typescript.

3.Inheritance: accessing parent class property into child class.
              - to perform Inheritance in between two class we use "extends". kwyword.
              syntax : class childClassName extends parentClassName.

          -super(): it represent parent class constructor in child class.
4.Encapsulation: warapping of data into single unit.

5.Abstraction: Hidding implementation and showing only functionality.
              - we can achieve by using interface and abstraction method,static keyword.

       access specifier:
       ->public : we can access class property inside class, outside class and in child class also.
       ->protected : we can access class property inside same class, in child class but not outside class.
       ->private: we can access class property with in same class.
       

6.Polymorpism: abiliry to take more than one form.
   -Method overloading : in this we have multiple method with same name in same class.
   -Method overriding: in this when we have multiple method with same name in differnt class;

*Modules in type : it can be collection of single or multiple typescript file, containing code with specific purpose or task and
                   that data or code we can access in another file by exporting and importing.
                 -we use export keyword to send data.

*interface : it is a blueprint or signature of class
          - it contain abstarct method in it.
          - we create a interface by using interface keyword.
          -  its child class has a responsibility to implement interface.
          - to perform inheritance in between class and interface we use "implement" keyword.
